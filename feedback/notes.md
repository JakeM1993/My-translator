# Review

## Goals

1. Working morse code translator - done
   - english to morse - done
   - morse to english - to work on
2. Practice using TDD - done
   - Great practice writing tests all of them pass.
3. Application of what you're learning (pure functions etc.) - Clean functions, and the app works - done
   ​

## Specification

​

- Translator functions and Unit tests to be written in separate files. Functions to be brought into the main.js and unit test files - done
  - You have done this, you do need to give you files .js files better names though
- Readme - kinda done
  - Technically has a README although there it needs a bit of polishing.
    - Add a spiel about the project
    - Talk about Jest
    - Add a section about set up so if someone came to project they know how to get it and run the tests.
    ```bash
    # get project
    git clone project-url
    # go into project
    cd project-name
    # add dependencies
    npm install
    # run test scripts
    npm run test
    ```
- 10 commits during development - not done
  - 9 commits so you were close but do your pseudo code and add when to commit on there as well.
- Mobile first/Responsive - done
  - Responsive and looks nice!
  - It doesn't handle a large sentence translation
- No tutorials - done
  - This work looks original
    ​

## Overall

​It was a tough one as it was your first project I am glad you got it under your belt. Keep on working on it and see what you can add to it.
In terms of JS you have separated your files which is great. Your translator is a pure function and you have tested it :). Your scss files are organized this is great. All your tests work and are passing.
​

## To work on

### House keeping

- Rename js files
  - file.js -> main.js
  - testable.js & testable.test.js should be more descriptive. -> translator.js?
- Tidy up code base
  - js files in js folder
  - delete commented out code
- Jazz up your readme
- Complete the extension

### Extension?

Have a crack at the extension. Could you use the same logic to get the other result?

- A new object with morse as keys and letters as values?
- A function that follows the same logic but just takes the morse input and uses that as a key?
- Could you test this?

Hey mate a lot of little things let me know if you want a hand or a further explanation.
